Every dataset tells a story. The hard part isn't finding the data — it's knowing which parts of it actually matter.

### The Problem with More Data
<br>

When I started doing analysis work, I made the mistake most analysts make early on: I tried to show everything. If the data was there, I included it. More charts, more tables, more metrics. I thought comprehensiveness was the point.

It isn't. Comprehensiveness is the enemy of clarity.

The person reading your report has a question they need answered. Your job is to answer it — not to demonstrate how much data you processed to get there.

<br>

### Start with the Question, Not the Data

Before I open a spreadsheet or write a query, I write the question in plain English at the top of a blank document. Not "analyze sales performance." Something specific: "Did the March promotion increase average order value for repeat customers in the Southeast region?"

That single sentence eliminates 80% of what I might otherwise spend time analyzing.

### The Three-Filter Method

When I'm exploring a new dataset, I use a simple three-step filter:

1. **Is it relevant?** Does this metric connect to the question I'm trying to answer? If not, set it aside.
2. **Is it reliable?** Do I trust the data? Is the collection method consistent? Are there obvious gaps or anomalies?
3. **Is it actionable?** Can someone actually do something with this insight? A finding no one can act on is just trivia.

Most data fails at least one of these filters. That's okay. Filtering is the job.

### The Specific Beats the General

"Sales are up" is noise. "Same-day orders on weekends are up 22% since we changed the checkout flow in November" is signal.

Specificity is what makes an insight useful. It tells you what changed, when it changed, and where to look next.

### Conclusion

The goal of analysis isn't to display data — it's to reduce uncertainty. Every chart, table, and number you include should serve that goal. When in doubt, cut it. The best analysis I've ever seen could fit on half a page.
